Your task: write a python module solution.py, inside which you need to place the code of the FileReader class. The constructor of this class takes one parameter: the path to the file on disk. In the FileReader class, the read method must be implemented, returning a string - the contents of the file, the path to which was specified when creating the class instance. The Python module must be written so that importing the FileReader class from it does not cause errors.

When writing an implementation of the read method, you need to consider the case when during initialization the path to a nonexistent file was transferred. You need to handle the FileNotFoundError exception that occurs in this case and return an empty string from the read method.
