Often when transferring some funds to the account we charge a commission. Let's implement a similar mechanism using descriptors. Write a handle to the Value that will be used in our Account class.

class Account:
    amount = Value()
    
    def __init__(self, commission):
        self.commission = commission

The account will have a commission attribute. It is this commission that needs to be subtracted when assigning values to amount.


new_account = Account(0.1)
new_account.amount = 100

print(new_account.amount)
90
