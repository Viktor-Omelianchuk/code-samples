In this task, you need to create an interface for working with files. The interface should provide the following capabilities for working with files:

- reading from a file, the read method returns a string with the current contents of the file

- write to a file, the write method takes as an argument a string with the new contents of the file

- addition of objects of type File, the result of addition is an object of class File, and a new file and a file object are created in which the contents of the second file are added to the contents of the first file.

- return the full path to the file as a string representation of an object of the File class

- support the iteration protocol, and iteration goes through the lines of the file

When creating an instance of the File class, the full path to the file on the file system is passed to the constructor. If a file with this path does not exist, it must be created during initialization.
